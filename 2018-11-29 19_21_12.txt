Model: <EOS> <EOS> <EOS> <EOS> <EOS> <EOS> <EOS> <EOS> is <EOS> 
Encoder :<SOS> any comparisons between honey and glitter are probably due to both movies having script-work by kate lanier who funnily enough isnt listed on the completed movie <EOS>

Decoder :to be honest the movie pretty much goes in one ear and out the other; theres not a single truly dramatic moment with the setbacks coming on cue when lil romeos character gets arrested it and many other moments in the movie plays like a less-than-brilliant after school special and the characters are right out of cliches central from the almost saintly title character to the sexually predatory rival dancer <EOS>
Model: <EOS> <EOS> is is is <EOS> is is is is <EOS> 
Encoder :<SOS> but its impossible to really hate honey; the movies too harmless and good-tempered for anyone to get into a hissyfit over its drawbacks and though the r&b-flavoured cameos mean a lot of people who see this movie will probably be going whos this tweet person <EOS>

Model: how about when when and lost what to that it in the end but the the over that hes that off his <EOS> and that his brain is stoner from the action <EOS> 
Encoder :<SOS> me too - by the films conclusion the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves and arrive at se7ens surprise ending without a single clue of it prior to it occurring <EOS>
Decoder :how about when mills and somerset ask to interrogate victor in the hospital but the doctor says that hes chewed off his tongue and that his brain is mush from the ordeal <EOS>
Model: funny is on on its own for all felt as it as is the same of the audience to be be in and #driveby by the animals short and dead are and <EOS> are they the filmmakers short of the director that that <EOS> 
Encoder :<SOS> thats another scene thats horrifying even though you dont see the gore <EOS>
Decoder :se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding and remain uncompromising and shocking thus satisfying the initial vision of the director david fincher <EOS>
Model: a pixar with films so for <EOS>

Encoder :<SOS> what was your favorite scene in this movie <EOS>
Decoder :i like the one in which mills brings somerset to his apartment which is mere feet away from the iconic feel of the el train in chicago marvin gayes trouble man played in the background as somerset who formally viewed mills as just a young punk playing a cop got to see him play with his dogs and interact with his wife <EOS>
Model: i love that part where after reynolds goes to the short and lost was where seen from the two <EOS> they find a or of from to with had and around the animations end that this excellent she is dory to filmmakers something about the the scene that <EOS> <EOS> would <EOS> 
Encoder :<SOS> mills and somerset are very intelligent characters <EOS>
Decoder :i love that part where after tracy goes to bed mills and somerset examine case evidence from the two scenes they find a picture of goulds wife with blood painted around the eyes realizing that this means she is supposed to spot something about the murder scene that nobody else would <EOS>

Encoder :<SOS> i know that was insane who do you think was the reason this movie was so good <EOS>

Decoder :maybe but i think another reason why the critics hate this film is because of the subversive message that it portrays in the script the writers grew up in the 50s and 60s when the paranoia of cold war was still in their faces everywhere they went after the cold war was over these same people started asking themselves well who is the enemy now <EOS>

Encoder :<SOS> what is your opinion about the movie <EOS>
Decoder :i think it was scary <EOS>
Model: this film is getting adaptations a lot but i cant help thinking that much of it might the from the fact that uses forward taken had paul where shoot the film then movie the result when he turned in his cut <EOS> 
Encoder :<SOS> its a somewhat difficult film but extremely good <EOS>
Decoder :this film is getting knocked a lot but i cant help thinking that much of it might stem from the fact that morgan creek initially had paul schrader shoot the film then canned the result when he turned in his cut <EOS>
Model: but the film has an incredible visual style the not between are extremely well unknown unknown the story and having having impact <EOS> 
Encoder :<SOS> it was said that they believed schraders version wasnt visceral enough so they hired renny harlin to direct and had a completely new script written although one still based on novelist caleb carrs initial treatment which he wrote after finding an older script that had been languishing in morgan creeks vaults or tomb as he calls it carr has been employed as a script polisher for morgan creek <EOS>
Decoder :but the film has an incredible visual style the gorier aspects are extremely well done--always servicing the story and having maximum impact <EOS>
Model: i think the filmmakers how is the trilogy dark face of war the beginning and its friday place in a very the series of films <EOS> 
Encoder :<SOS> and the special effects are often subtle and for my money the sparse use of cgi most noticeably with the hyenas is handled brilliantly the current trend towards monochromatic cinematography is strongly present but rather than overused blues harlin has cinematographer vittorio storaro embed us in browns/sepia tones and grays with many scenes having very deep shadows <EOS>
Decoder :i think the primary attraction is the emotionally dark face of exorcist: the beginning and its comfortable place in a very unusual series of films <EOS>

Model: true i liked that the movie has some good make and the martian ninja looks convincing but theres nothing he here to back for the lack of an until told story <EOS> 
Encoder :<SOS> just because a movie grosses a lot of money doesnt mean its great though <EOS>
Decoder :true i liked that the movie has some good fx and the martian landscape looks convincing but theres nothing exceptional here to compensate for the lack of an effectively told story <EOS>
Model: yeah i get that i thought it was so dumb when on doesnt doesnt but will not comic his iconic either im like just get over it already <EOS>

Model: i liked the one which he made the films beautiful <EOS> 
Encoder :<SOS> which was the best scene in the movie according to you <EOS>

Model: a fairly on seeing plot but one which offers many dramatic sure <EOS> 
Encoder :<SOS> that was such an incredible scene how do you feel about the entire movie <EOS>
Decoder :a fairly standard castaway plot but one which offers many dramatic possibilities <EOS>
Model: this is adaptations because the too is ruthless but also because the boy the 13th and faces seem to be so easily casey <EOS> 
Encoder :<SOS> but i think the movie is a great one that is plausible <EOS>

Encoder :<SOS> yes but i like the movie graphics and its landscape <EOS>
Decoder :although the movie has some good fx and the martian landscape looks convincing but theres nothing exceptional here to compensate for the lack of an effectively told story <EOS>
Model: unknown this is the main reason like damon effectively portrays the martian as a likable guy but the problem is how to fill the two hours of the movie that remain after he is stranded when a character is alone and unable to hasnt it needs something exceptional to keep us us to the screen <EOS> 
Encoder :<SOS> maybe because there is only one astronaut surviving on the mars land <EOS>
Decoder :off-course this is the main reason like damon effectively portrays the martian as a likable guy but the problem is how to fill the two hours of the movie that remain after he is stranded when a character is alone and unable to communicate it needs something exceptional to keep us glued to the screen <EOS>
Model: yes you are correct the script is written on the on that the audience is a little dumb e gross made it will be one sols martian days before we can rescue him and but his food will run out in you sols unknown so hell die before we get there <EOS>

Model: oh yes the trailer of die die am nick and storyline frank is probably one of the greatest scenes ever shot the only i can think of that would rival it for the scenes spot is intense and the globe from actor the great rambo and the last scene is probably even familiar to the few people various never seen casablanca <EOS> 
Encoder :<SOS> i agree because many of scenes have become a part of film history; <EOS>
Decoder :oh yes the duel of die wacht am rhein and la marseillaise is probably one of the greatest scenes ever shot the only i can think of that would rival it for the #1 spot is hynkel and the globe from chaplins the great dictator and the last scene is probably even familiar to the few people whove never seen casablanca <EOS>
Model: i agree but but still put is not a soldiers character and it took more than with years until another actor gave an theme maybe even more impressive performance as a villains off game in schindlers list but why no one ever off s trailer quickly who plays classic the richard player at ricks liked colonel is beyond me he has definitely more screen time than worked in and wilson and probably about as much as out and hes a joy whenever hes on the screen <EOS> 
Encoder :<SOS> i observed that conrad veidt as major strasser had a really difficult task here as his character is the only evil one <EOS>
Decoder :i agree but but still strasser is not a one-dimensional character and it took more than 50 years until another actor gave an equally maybe even more impressive performance as a nazi ralph fiennes in schindlers list but why no one ever mentions s k sakall who plays carl the jolly waiter at ricks caf amricain is beyond me he has definitely more screen time than lorre greenstreet and wilson and probably about as much as veidt and hes a joy whenever hes on the screen <EOS>
